# LibraryManagementSystemWithRFID

  A library management system that uses RFID scanner & tags to aid in tracking books, users, and various library transactions. It uses two (2) RFID hardwares. A short-ranged RFID scanner is positioned at the librarian's desk (or any other place) and is being used for library transactions like borrowing/returning of books.  A long-ranged RFID scanner is placed at the library entrance/exit. The latter's purpose is to scan for "unborrowed" books being brought outside of the library so the system can sound an alarm if checkout of book is unwarranted.

  Fine/charge/fee for late returning of books and the number of days allowed for borrowing depends on what Secion the book belongs to.
